              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Every photo session is unique, and I strive to create a comfortable and enjoyable experience. 
                I meticulously prepare for each session, bringing tailored posing ideas designed to reveal 
                your authentic personality. My sessions are conducted exclusively outdoors, utilizing natural 
                light to create soft, flattering photographs that capture genuine moments and tell your 
                personal story.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My photography style is clean, classic, and elegantly sophisticated. I believe in the power 
                of simplicity and timelessness, creating images that will be cherished for generations. 
                Attention to detail is paramount â€“ from the subtle play of light and shadow to the careful 
                composition of each shot. I focus on revealing the essence of each subject through carefully 
                crafted, emotionally resonant imagery.
